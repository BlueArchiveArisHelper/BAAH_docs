2. Check if the software has an [update](../manual/QA.md#0-how-to-update-baah), and try updating to the latest version.
3. If you are in the QQ group, you can first browse through the group chat history to see if there are similar situations and how they were resolved.
4. Read GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/BlueArchiveArisHelper/BAAH/issues), including closed [Issues](https://github.com/BlueArchiveArisHelper/BAAH/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed), to see if there are similar problems.

### When Asking Questions
Solving problems without sufficient information is no different than trying to build a car behind closed doors. Therefore, when asking questions, please ensure you provide effective information, including:
   
   · Game server, BAAH version number

   · Describe the environment where the problem occurs (machine configuration, operating system, application, and related information)

   · Carefully and clearly describe the symptoms of your problem, that is, what you want BAAH to do.

   · Describe BAAH's behavior before and after the error occurs, or record a complete video of the problem.

   · Provide BAAH's logs, which are usually under `BAAH\DATA\LOGS`. Please reproduce the problem once and prepare the latest logs. If logs cannot be saved, please check the options `Whether output log to /DATA/LOGS/ directory` and `Whether save log when error occurs` in `Other Settings`.
