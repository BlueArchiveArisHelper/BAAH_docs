# Assault

::: warning

All automatic battles will use the game's default `AUTO` mode. Please ensure your team is sufficiently leveled.

~~What? You can't even clear it manually? Then the script definitely can't do it either.~~

This feature can only complete daily token farming, and cannot be used for score optimization.
:::

Assault can automatically complete daily Assault stages using `AUTO` mode, and can automatically progress to the target difficulty.

You need to configure your teams in advance in the Assault interface.

## Configuration

Configure the target difficulty level by entering a number. The target difficulty should be approximately two levels lower than your manual clear level.

| **Number** | **Difficulty** |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| 1          | Normal        |
| 2          | Hard          |
| 3          | Very Hard     |
| 4          | Hardcore      |
| 5          | Extreme       |
| 6          | Insane        |
| 7          | Torment       |
| 8          | Lunatic       |
